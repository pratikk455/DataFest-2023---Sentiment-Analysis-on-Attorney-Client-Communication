We began our data analysis journey with a meticulous exploration of the data, where we employed the use of pandas and R to merge and clean multiple CSV files. During this process, we discovered various patterns and relationships that inspired us to venture into the realm of sentiment analysis. We utilized the bag of words technique to compute sentiment values for every question posed by clients to attorneys. This methodology entails breaking down a piece of text into individual words and tallying the frequency of each word to establish a numerical representation of the text from -1 to 1 where -1 is the negative sentiment and 1 is a positive sentiment. The computed numerical representation was then utilized to categorize the questions into two distinct vibes - rude or chill.

To gain further comprehension of the overall vibe of attorney-client communication, we created a visually compelling word cloud that depicted the most frequent words employed in both chill and rude questions. The word cloud is a graphical illustration of the most common words utilized in a given text, where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency. This provided us with valuable insights into the underlying sentiments of clients, helping us to identify the most frequent words employed in both chill and rude questions. Wordcloud helped in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in legal communication.

Next, we computed the average sentiment value of all the States in the United States by using external data such as latitude and longitude to map out the states. After mapping out the states, we plotted the average sentiment values on the map, using a color gradient that ranged from low to high sentiment values. This allowed us to easily identify the most chill and rudest states in the United States. Upon analysis, we discovered that North Carolina and Delaware had the most chill sentiment value, while Kansas had the highest rude sentiment value. This provided us with valuable insights into the overall sentiments of clients towards attorneys across different states in the United States.

Our study aimed to investigate whether there was any significant difference in the time taken by attorneys to respond to questions based on the vibe of the question. We calculated the time taken by attorneys by taking the difference between TakenbyAttorney and ClosedonUTC and categorized them into two distinct vibes - rude and chill. We then calculated the mean difference in time taken by attorneys in these two categories and found a p-value of less than 0.0001, indicating that there was a significant difference in the time taken by attorneys to respond to rude and chill questions. To further understand the magnitude of this difference, we calculated Cohen's D effect size, which was found to be 0.069. This suggests that the means of the two sentiment groups differ by only 0.069 standard deviations, indicating a very small effect size.

The analysis has provided insights into how to enhance attorney-client communication and reduce the occurrence of rude questions, which can result in faster response times. To achieve this, clear and concise prompts can be provided to clients when they ask questions. These prompts should include examples of appropriate language and tone, and guidance on the type of information that should be included in the question. Providing clients with a well-defined framework can reduce ambiguity and misunderstandings, which can help to minimize the likelihood of rude questions being asked, ultimately reducing the time attorneys take.
